# Start Using Mongosh | Simple Task
Here you'll given a task to work on, Just to practice basic mongoDB commands. 
Please take your time to practice and discover more things than the listed below.

Maybe you can get help form [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/)

1- Create your first MongoDB, and switch to it.

2- Create a `users` collection within the created db.

3- Insert a new single user, then multiple users once.
  ```json
    {"name": "farah"}
  ```
   ```json
    [
      {"name": "Lina"},
      {"name": "Ahmed"},
      {"name": "Wissam"},
      {"name": "Ali"},
      {"name": "Sara"}
    ]
  ```
4- Try to select or find users you have.

5- Update user `farah` to add `{ age: 25 }`

6- Add a last name, an email, and a city to users start with `A`.

7- Use the command `db.users.find()` to see how the collection can accomodate different document objects.

  Notice how the old document did not change, but the new one has a last name, an email, and a city. This is one of the biggest features of No-SQL database models. It can be very flexible, which means it scales incredibly well.

8- Delete document `farah`.

9- Delete documents start with `A`.
